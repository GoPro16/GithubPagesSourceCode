              I grew up in Jacksonville practically all my life. I graduated
              from Bartram Trail High School in 2015 and started at UNF
              over the Summer of 2015. Growing up I played a lot of video games
              and also had an interest
              for programming/modding games. My first programming class was
              during my Senior Year of High School in AP Computer Science.
              I didn't pass the AP Exam however I learned a lot in the class and
              I took all of the Summer
              to learn Java and C before starting my freshmen computing classes
              in the Fall.

              Two years later and here I am. I have gained so much knowledge
              from school and other mentors
              along the way. I currently am working with a start up company as a
              backend developer for
              their service. On the side, I build websites for local companies
              using the latest web development
              tools. I am always looking for new languages to learn.

              I am aspiring to be a Full Stack developer for a company one day
              or perhaps to found a
              company for custom solutions for anyone and everyone. I plan on
              graduating from UNF in Spring
              of 2018 with a
              <i>

              has in store for me down the road.
